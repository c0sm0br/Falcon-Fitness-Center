    <p> SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a format that uses markup language to create two-dimensional graphics, images, and animations. It provides very rudimentary graphics for your webpage. All other graphics, must be JPEG or PNG and these have to be downloaded or uploaded from a source outside of your website. </p>
